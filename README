This is the code behind the Grand Rapids WiFi website - http://grwifi.net

The site is in the process of changing hands, so there's no guarantee it'll continue to use this code, but as I was upgrading it to Rails 2.3 I thought I might as well put it on github and make it public.

Please don't mistake this code for code I'd write today. This was my testing ground for different tools for a long time, but fell into neglect after I stopped living in Grand Rapids.
