  excerpt: well i got there and found a nice table with an outlet, but there were very few outlets to be found, I saw only 2. After one hour my connection dried up, cut out, even tho signal strength was rated as good, and diagnostics said I was connected. ??? is there a one hour time limit? Well, I had a nice sandwich anyway. I will check out the other locations during the week and see what is going on.

  excerpt: "To clarify the above response by Bill VandenMoler, GRNow is an independently owned and operated portal site which focuses on providing information and tools for residents and visitors of the Grand Rapids area. I personally began this site approximately two years ago under the name GrandRapidsLive.com and recently updated and changed it to GRNow.com. I am still, and will continue to be, the sole owner and operator.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    GRNow is a strategic partner with FreedomNet; our partnerships have been, and will continue to be very public. We provide real-time content on their wireless splash pages, and they advertise on the GRNow site. I am, in fact, located on the same floor in the Select Bank building as FreedomNet; however, we have separate offices.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I, too, have been quite interested in the GR Wireless Broadband project. FreedomNet has been featured because it is the only locally owned and operated wireless provider vying for the contract to make the city wireless, and I think that is special. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    As far as the wifi test, we simply took a laptop to the different areas which were assigned by the city for the month of June and posted the results. FreedomNet has had a head start in this competition because they\xE2\x80\x99ve been building a network over the past months. The other competitors do not have as complete or stable a network in place. For example, Nortel Networks was assigned the Calder Plaza area to provide wireless. Based on my investigation, it looks as they connected a small number of linksys routers to light poles, flipped them upside down, and added longer antennas. That system is not (and according to our test, has not) provided stable, fast coverage. At two of the other network locations, 700 Fuller Ave NE and at the Van Andel institute, a connection could simply not be found. It\xE2\x80\x99s not bashing other companies; it\xE2\x80\x99s simply reporting the facts. If individuals who are more familiar with wireless cannot find a connection, how much more difficult will it be for the average Grand Rapids resident just beginning to learn about wifi? This type of user was our target for the story, because we try to bring technology and information to average internet users. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    616.454.0400\r\n"

  excerpt: Who offers free wifi in a grocery store? When I first heard that Forest Hills Foods offered wireless in their cafe, I imagined bright flourescent lighting with unobstructed views of canned goods. Ed's brief comment about his visit did nothing to dispell my notions, yet I wanted to give it a try as a central location for the two of us to meet and hash out the details of a joint project

  excerpt: |
    If you ever took an iBook or PowerBook to Woody's on East Paris, and sometimes had real difficulties getting a DHCP lease, I'm sorry to report that will sometimes be the case here too -- they inherited the exact cranky Linksys router that Woody's used when Woody's closed down.
    
    However, you can walk forty feet from the cafe and have sushi prepared to order by the resident chefs, or if that's not your bag, walk around the corner and get fried chicken and home fries.
    
    And they have diet mountain dew in the soda fountain, a weakness of mine.
    
    So it's worth struggling with the connections sometimes.

Outlets are limited but I found one easily. Crowded with students and chess-players on a rainy day. Signal strength is outstanding and needs no configuration. A bit of old Europe.

  excerpt: Justin Valmassoi, Morningstar's owner, is a thief, a liar, a predator of teenage girls and a girl-beater, too.  He got the money for the first place in Eastown by taking it on loan from one of his many girlfriends and never paying it back.  What she did about it, I don't know, but she's one of the scores of girls who say Justin would both brow-beat her and physically beat her, and she was just happier to be rid of him, even if it cost her $3K.  Hey, beatings or not, nobody said she had to be a dummy and "lend" it to him.  Don't support this guy.  He's already got that combo of clever, attractive, intelligent, deceitful and shady, so he'll be rich and famous without your help.

    Hello.
     
    My name is David Pilgrim and I am the founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University.  This anti-racism museum is both a real place and an Internet museum (www.ferris.edu/jimcrow).  Our goal is to use objects of intolerance to teach tolerance.  It works.  We have created a place where people, from all races, talk openly and honestly about race, race relations, and racism. I invite you to visit the online museum.  Also, I am sending the URL of a recent article that I wrote, "The Garbage Man: Why I Collect Racist Objects."  The URL is http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/collect/.
     
    Thanks for the work that you do.

    As Kate mentioned, the coffee and scones are excelent.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The only drawback?  The place is so friendly, it tends to draw more than its share of street people.  That's fine if I'm working solo, but it can make conducting a business meeting or presentation....interesting.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Also, as Kate noted, there are limited power outlets.  Not a problem for me, since I have four hours of batter time, but it could be an issue for others.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I give Four Friends a 9/10.  "

Wired access is available  -- Ethernet outlets are numerous, and ethernet cables are  available from the service counter.( A dedicated T-1 line will be available soon -- per the staff.).... Lots of coffee choices and food -- Panini's, bagel sandwiches, 2 soups and 2 salads daily. Open early even on Sundays. Staff were courteous and knowledgeable. Atmosphere friendly with spicy coffee aromas. Recommended.

    Im there right now. It's not bad. It doesn't quite have the intensely friendly atmosphere of the Panera about half a mile west of here (the manager there, Bill, is a super nice guy, but it's a nice place. Slightly smaller selection of sandwiches (huh. Lotta s's there), but it has some breakfast options that Panera doesn't have (egg and cheese sandwiches).

Outlets are limited. Signal is good, you have to log onto the Panera network, which takes you to a screen that wants your email for the 'Panera Newsletter', I declined, prefering my privacy. Overall I am impressed, the aromas of the bread created a nice atmosphere for 'surfin' and haveing some coffee.

Why should I enter payment information, which they state will be used for future contact with me, when I have no desire to pay for this service? How do I know they are a reputable company and won't start charging me without notice?
    
    If the service is free, it should be FREE, not a masked attempt to get my information for future use.

  excerpt: "Before a few coffee shops in my immediate neighborhood got wireless access, I used to go to Four Friends at least once a week to use theirs. I always got a great, strong connection; the only downside is that there are very few sockets in the walls. I could never find anywhere to plug in towards the front of the shop, so I always had to sit in the same spot near the back. Next time I'm there I'll suggest they at least get a power strip. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Four Friends' atmosphere is friendly and inviting, and there are lots of interesting people to watch (and talk to, if you're so inclined). Plus, the coffee's good and they serve Wealthy Street Bakery scones, which are pretty much the best thing ever. "

    Before the inital startup of the Grand Rapids trial on June 1st FreedomNet required a credit card to signup in order to identify who was using our system prior to the Grand Rapids Trial.  As of June 1st and for the entire length of the Grand Rapids City Demonstration time period FreedomNet no longer requires any form of signup.  The network is 100% open at this time and has shown over 100 free trials in the month of June already.  We look forward to continually working with the City of Grand Rapids and its residents/visitors for the betterment of FreedomNet's network and the ultimate goal of unwiring the entire City.

  hide: 0
  commentable_type: Location

  excerpt: |
    My reactions are mixed.  Two signs on the door seemed very unfriendly to me.  "Restroom for customers only" and "Wireless for customers only (1 drink minimum)".
    
    This is a coffee house in a strip mall out in the pucks.  Do they really have a problem with an excess of people walking by and trying to use their restroom?  Has that really caused a problem in the past, such that they need to put it out there on a sign?  Or are they just kind of jerks who resent the idea that they might possibly be duped into providing a service to the public without remuneration?
    
    As for the "wireless for customers only (1 drink minimum)", I can understand that they don't want people plunking down and using their connection for hours on end without buying anything.  I would never do that.  But I'd like to imagine that they feel they could trust me to do that without the sign.  (Also, isn't the "1 drink minimum" redundant?  How could you be a customer by buying less than 1 drink?  Are they saying it wouldn't count if I bought breath mints?  Have they seriously encountered a problem with customers coming in and using their wireless but buying LESS than one drink?)
    
    Oh, there's also a handmade sign saying "Kava Cop says STOP: One Drink Minimum."  So not only can't you use the wifi without a drink, you can't even be there without a drink.
    
    The signs out front give the impression that these people are obsessed by the fear that someone may get something from them for nothing -- that their precious seating space and ambience and wifi may be abused by the unwashed, no-drink-buying masses.  This comes across as massively hostile to me.  I have not seen anything like it at any other wifi enabled coffee house in the area.  It's bizarre.  I have a hard time believing, given the location, that it's based on actual problems with deadbeats rather than just a general mean-spiritedness.
    
    Apart from the signs it's been good.  Lots of available power-pluggage, pleasant atmosphere,  reasonable connection, a guy who I assume was the manager was helpful, wanted to make sure I could find a plug, friendly staff.  Everything's good, but man, the signs really convey hostility to the public.

    Discussing this on my blog, Alan said "where there are signs like that it almost always means there is a high school nearby."  There's one across the street from this Kava House.  I bet that's the reason for the signs.  Fair enough!
    
    As I said, it's a cool place in general.

With his imperialistic bullshit and rudeness to his employees, it\'s no surprise why he has lost his residual customer base.  His only success will be because of location and convienience.

  excerpt: "My experience at Bean Tree Bistro was probably marred by the children's birthday party that settled in at the next table, but then again it is an easy stop for parents and their children as they come and go from shopping. On the outskirts of Rivertown Crossings Mall, the vibe is that of an upscale mall coffeeshop:"

    I wrote the original comment. Basically the place caters to a variety of ages, but I heard from the owner that it's pretty similar to a gay bar at night, appealling to those too young to go to an actual bar.
    
    That's what I was told anyway. The few times I've been in there that late I've been more interested in getting coffee than taking a poll of people's ages and sexuality.

  excerpt: I am very impressed with morningstar. Its a casual coffee house, that allows people to relax in a calming environment, or have fun in an upbeat scenario. It's very impressive.

    I have been reading with interest the GRNow.com site, and I am impressed with the coverage of the GR WiFi test.  A little digging showed that GRNow.com is apparently owned by FreedomNet Solutions, or at least receives it\'s mail at the FreedomNet offices (60 Monroe Center, Suite 501, Grand Rapids, MI).
    
    Seems like a major conflict of interest when a \"news\" site has so much favorable coverage about one company that it is shacking up with (literally, in this case), and slams the other providers.
    
    How about some real, objective coverage?
