    </p><p>For convenience there are also a couple of shortcuts. To find out which locations are open right now you can go directly to <a href="/open/now">http://grwifi.net/open/now</a> and to find locations in a particular zip code you just go to http://grwifi.net/zip/xxxxx (ie. <a href="/zip/49503">http://grwifi.net/zip/49503</a>).
    
    Enjoy! And don't forget to email <a href="mailto:wifi@grwifi.net">wifi@grwifi.net</a> if you have comments or suggestions.
  content: The theme of the month is 'search'. I've been meaning to add keyword and time-based searches for a while now and now you have them. The '<a href="/search">advanced search</a>' option lets you specify a whole range of options by which to search, including keywords and opening hours.

According to <a href="http://www.grcmc.org/inthemedia_20041123.php">this article</a> one of their plans for the location is to "wireless canopy" that would provide Internet service for the street and surrounding areas. This service may then become part of City plans for total wireless coverage.

Some reports suggest this could be an act we'll see replicated. If you appreciate free WiFi in coffee shops, be sure to pull your weight, engage with other customers, and buy plenty of coffee!
  content: WiFi Net News recently carried <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/005325.html">this story of how one Seattle coffee shop has decided to switch off its WiFi at weekends</a>.

    A few new features this month. Firstly, the sidebars on the front page have been changed. You should now see two of four sidebars which will be selected at random each time you load the page. The hope is that they'll get some more traffic to a few of the lower profile hotspots we feature. Behind this change is a whole new mechanism for sidebars which should make it much easier to add new ones, so let us know if you have ideas.</p>
    
    <p>I've also made it easier to navigate between news stories and finally added a comment feature for news stories. There's a lot more coming, and with all these new features piling up a new design will be coming along before too long.

    Right now, you can either search by location or use the old search mechanism&#8212;we're working on combining the two searches to give you still more control.
    
    For the techies among you, we've also added RDF data on all the loations listed. Look in the HTML headers for that.
  content: "Since the site launched what we've really wanted to offer is a way of searching for wifi locations near to you. Now, thanks to the services of <a href=\"http://geocoder.us\">geocoder.us</a> that's available. If you go to <a href=\"/search\">the advanced search</a> page you can enter your address and find the 15 locations nearest to you, ordered by distance. "

  content: Yesterday Google announced an official interface so that programmers can make use of their mapping technology. I've updated the <a href="/gmaps">Grand Rapids WiFi google map</a> to use that interface and it can now be used. This is still experimental, so links around the site may not reflect this new map for a while, but I hope to offer search results plotted on a map and other map-based tools soon.

  content: As promised, I've spent more time working on google maps integration for the site, and the results are now live. Behind the scenes I've actually completely reworked the search code so that it's much easier to add on extra ways of viewing the search results and now every search on the site can be viewed on a map, with links between map view and regular view. There are a few locations missing from the map view as I haven't been able to pinpoint longitude/latitude for them, but hopefully the gaps will be filled soon.

  content: Last week we received a comment making various accusations against a particular individual. This site is not intended as a forum for such comments and that comment has now been removed. This is not a judgement of the truthfulness or otherwise of its content. We are glad that the majority of users keep comments on this site focussed on the quality of service of wifi locations in Grand Rapids. Other grievances should be pursued through more appropriate fora.

It also makes clear that the North-West side has some catching up to do!

    I've extended the site's support of RDF, so not only is there now an <a href="/rss1/">RSS1</a> feed of news, there's also an <a href="/rdf/">RDF index</a> listing all the locations, and the RDF resource for each page now features a listing of comments.
    
    The key advantage of these new features is that it will make it much easier to integrate this site with other applications. RDF is a key component of the semantic web.
  content: This month sees some rather techie upgrades, designed to make the site inteoperate better with others.
