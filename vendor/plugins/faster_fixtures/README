FasterFixtures
==============

FasterFixtures helps your tests run faster by avoiding fixtures being loaded more than once.

To do this, 1 easy step:

* Stick require 'faster_fixtures' at the top of your test_helper.rb

That's all! Whenever fixtures are loaded they will be cached and on subsequent testcases they will not be loaded

You must be using transactional tests or bad things will happen (changes made by individual tests will persist across different test). It would not be hard to change to code to allow certain tables (eg if you have a single MyISAM table used for fulltext indexing) to not have their fixtures cached.

Time.now will be stubbed out during the tests, so you should not rely on Time increasing during your tests (almost as if you had an infinitely fast machine). The value of Time.now for the duration of the tests will be value Time.now had when the tests were started.

If you want to run the (currently rather meagre) tests, you'll need to create a faster_fixtures database (the script test/rails_root/db/create_databases.sql will create it and the appropriate user)

Feedback welcome
