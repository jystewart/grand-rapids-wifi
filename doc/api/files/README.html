      <h2>Welcome to <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is a web-application and
persistence framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web-applications according to the Model-View-Control
pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also called the
presentation) into &quot;dumb&quot; templates that are primarily
responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model
contains the &quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account, Product,
Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist
themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests
(such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the
model and directing data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, the model is handled by
what&#8216;s called an object-relational mapping layer entitled Active
Record. This layer allows you to present the data from database rows as
objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You
can read more about Active Record in <a
href="vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. You can
read more about Action Pack in <a
href="vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Run the WEBrick servlet: <tt>ruby script/server</tt> (run with &#8212;help
for options) &#8230;or if you have lighttpd installed: <tt>ruby
script/lighttpd</tt> (it&#8216;s faster)

</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ and get
&quot;Congratulations, you&#8216;ve put Ruby on <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>!&quot;

</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines on the &quot;Congratulations, you&#8216;ve put Ruby
on <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>!&quot; screen

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example for Apache conf</h2>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName rails
    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log

    &lt;Directory /path/application/public/&gt;
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
      Allow from all
      Order allow,deny
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So
ExecCGI should be on and &quot;.cgi&quot; should respond. All requests from
127.0.0.1 go through CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes.
All other requests go through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart
to show changes.
</p>
<h2>Debugging <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
Have &quot;tail -f&quot; commands running on both the server.log,
production.log, and test.log files. <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will automatically display debugging
and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown
in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>
Breakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client.
This means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code,
investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find_all
      breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things
like:
</p>
<p>
Executing breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot; at
&#8230;/webrick_server.rb:16 in &#8216;breakpoint&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,
       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects
actually work:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first
  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
  &gt;&gt; f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when you&#8216;re ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D
</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>
You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through
script/console. Here you&#8216;ll have all parts of the application
configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can
inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting
the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>console
production</tt>.
</p>
<h2>Description of contents</h2>

app
</p>
<pre>
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
</pre>

  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.
</pre>
<p>

  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblog/index.rhtml for the WeblogController#index action. All views use eRuby
  syntax. This directory can also be used to keep stylesheets, images, and so on
  that can be symlinked to public.
